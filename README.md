## About The App:

I have built akanban board that allows a user to enter a github repository link and view that repo's issues. The user can also move each item between three different columns: ToDo, In Progress and Done. Any changes made by the user are stored so if they leave ot refresh the browser then they can come back to the app exactly as they left it. The user can also visit the repo owner's profile or the repo itself by clicking the links beneath the the input component.
